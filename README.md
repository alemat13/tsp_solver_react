# TSP Solver - React

A web application built with React to visualize and solve the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP).

This project provides an interactive interface for users to define a set of "cities" on a 2D plane and then run various algorithms to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.

## ✨ Features

*   **Interactive Canvas**: Add, move, or remove cities directly on the map.
*   **Algorithm Visualization**: Watch in real-time as algorithms work to find the optimal path.
*   **Multiple Algorithms**: Compare the results of different TSP-solving algorithms (e.g., Nearest Neighbor, 2-Opt, etc.).
*   **Performance Metrics**: View the total distance of the calculated path and the time taken to compute it.
*   **Responsive Design**: Works on a wide range of screen sizes.
