# Gemini Code Understanding

This document provides an overview of the TSP Solver React project, generated by Gemini.

## Project Overview

This project is a web-based tool for solving the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). It allows users to input a list of coordinates, and then visualizes the optimal route on a map. The application is built using React and TypeScript.

The core functionality of the application is to find the shortest possible route that visits a set of user-defined points and returns to the origin. It offers several algorithms to achieve this, and it uses the OpenRouteService API to fetch real-world road network data.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Mapping Library**: Leaflet, with `react-leaflet` for React integration.
- **Routing**: OpenRouteService for distance and geometry data.

## Key Components

### `src/App.tsx`

This is the main component of the application. It manages the application's state, including:

- User input (raw coordinate data, API key).
- Application settings (travel mode, solver mode).
- The solution to the TSP problem (the optimized route, distance, and duration).
- The map view, which displays the points and the calculated route.

It orchestrates the process of parsing user input, calling the appropriate TSP solver, and displaying the results.

### `src/components/`

This directory contains the React components that make up the user interface:

- `CoordinateInput.tsx`: A text area for users to input coordinates.
- `OptionsForm.tsx`: A form for configuring the solver, such as selecting the travel mode and solver algorithm.
- `SolutionPanel.tsx`: A panel to display the results of the TSP calculation.
- `MapView.tsx`: The component that renders the map with the points and the route.

### `src/algorithms/`

This directory contains the implementations of the different TSP-solving algorithms.

- **`bruteForce.ts`**: An exact algorithm that finds the optimal solution by trying every possible permutation of points. This is only feasible for a small number of points.
- **`heuristic.ts`**: A heuristic algorithm that finds a near-optimal solution using a combination of the nearest neighbor and 2-opt algorithms. This is much faster than the brute-force approach and is suitable for a larger number of points.
- **`adaptive.ts`**: This is the default solver. It adaptively chooses between the brute-force and heuristic algorithms based on the number of points. For a small number of points, it uses the brute-force solver to find the exact solution. For a larger number of points, it switches to the heuristic solver to find a good solution in a reasonable amount of time.

### `src/services/openRouteService.ts`

This file contains the logic for interacting with the OpenRouteService API. It is used to fetch the distance matrix between all pairs of points and to get the route geometry for drawing the path on the map.

## How to Run

1.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
3.  Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173` (or whatever port Vite assigns).

To use the routing features, you will need to obtain an API key from [OpenRouteService](https://openrouteservice.org/) and enter it into the application's options form.
